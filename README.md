# Time Tracks V2 
### Improving on the original Time Tracks App

This project is focused on learning the Laravel framework via improving an app I originally made with vanilla PHP and PostgreQL. Check that out [Here](https://github.com/david-vanderhaar/task-keeper)

__Planned Improvements__

* Update Front-end with Google's Materialize
* Build queries with Laravel's MVC structure
* Add a timer feature for real-time task tracking
